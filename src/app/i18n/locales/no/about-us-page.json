		"description": "Established in 2010, H-fasader Baltic UAB is a subsidiary of the Norwegian company H-fasader AS, a leading manufacturer specializing in the production of aluminium facades and PVC windows and doors in Norway. Our commitment to growth materialized with the construction of a new factory in 2020, strategically located in Siauliai FEZ (Free Economical Zone). This expansion not only increased the production of PVC products but also marked the commencement of manufacturing Sapa aluminum products, including facades, windows, doors, and fire-resistant products. We deliver high-quality PVC windows with excellent wind and rain resistance. A standout among our PVC products is the outward opening top swing windows with Spilka hinges designed for extreme climate. PVC products certified for both Norwegian (NDVK) and EU markets.
